# Hello, I'm Abhinav Sattiraju!

I am currently a freshman at Georgia Institute of Technology pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with concentrations in Intelligence and Theory, as well as a Minor in Robotics.

I am passionate about applying data science, machine learning, and deep learning to real-world applications such as in the healthcare industry, drawing inspiration from endeavors such as Neuralink. I am currently learning more about front-end web development and am looking to apply my skills in that area.
